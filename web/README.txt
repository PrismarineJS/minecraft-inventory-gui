Copy the `textures` folder from the default Minecraft resource pack to this directory, then host this folder using the following commands to open the index.html file:

If you're on Python 2: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

If you're on Python 3: `python -m http.server`
*Note: depending on how Python was installed, you may have to do `python3 -m http.server` instead.

You can import inventories from ../lib/inventories.mjs
